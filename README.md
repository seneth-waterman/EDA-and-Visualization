# EDA-and-Visualization
This repository showcases my journey in the "EDA and Visualization" course, presenting assignments that have sharpened my skills in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the art of visual storytelling with Python.

## Homework Assignments

### Homework 1: Foundations in NumPy and Pandas
* Objectives: To grasp the basics of NumPy and Pandas through manipulation of data structures and performing data analysis tasks.
* Skills: Array and Series creation, manipulation, and boolean indexing in NumPy. Dataframe operations in Pandas including data selection, filtering, and basic EDA techniques.

### Homework 2: Advanced Data Visualization
* Objectives: Dive deeper into data visualization techniques using matplotlib and pandas for creating insightful plots.
* Skills: Creating various types of plots (line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, etc.), customizing plot aesthetics, and interpreting data through visualizations.

### Homework 3: Real-world Dataset Exploration
* Objectives: Conduct EDA on the Kaggle Spaceship Titanic dataset to prepare data for modeling and gain insights.
* Skills: Data cleaning and preprocessing, handling missing values, feature engineering, and developing a series of visualizations to explore the dataset deeply.

### Homework 4: Advanced Visualization and Design
* Objectives: Employ advanced visualization techniques to recreate and design plots for specific datasets, focusing on aesthetic and informative visual design.
* Skills: Recreating complex plots from given examples, utilizing design principles to enhance plot interpretability and appeal, and creatively designing plots to convey specific insights effectively.

## Case Study 

### Case Study: Airbnb New York
* Objective: Conduct exploratory data analysis on the Airbnb dataset, creating visualizations that clearly and effectively convey key business insights, with a strong adherence to design principles for maximum clarity and impact.
* Skills: Data cleaning, data visualization
